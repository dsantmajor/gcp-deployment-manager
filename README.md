# Deployment Manager Examples

Google Cloud Deployment Manager is an infrastructure management service that makes it simple to create, deploy, and manage Google Cloud Platform resources. With Deployment Manager, you can create a static or dynamic template that describes the configuration of your Google Cloud environment and then use Deployment Manager to create these resources as a single deployment.

This repository contains example templates for use with Deployment Manager.

For an overview of Deployment Manager, see https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs.
